# Zombie Ruber Ducky Detection

We will use Tensorflow's Object Detection API and retrain [RetinaNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002) to spot Zombies and Rubber Duckies using just 5 training images of each.

We will setup the model to restore pretrained weights and fine tune the classification layers.
